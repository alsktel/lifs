## About LIFS

## About this tool
This is a cross-platform tool for creating disk images with LIFS. 
It supports LIFS partitioning, converting files to LIFS units and adding 
SXB0 (boot sector and second sector of [SXB](https://github.com/eastev/sxb)).
After creating a partition you need a directory with something you want to
write on this partition. Adding SXB0 is necessary for system disks, but you 
may add no bootloaders for other (not system) disks.

For more information about LIFS creation process use: `mklifs -h`
